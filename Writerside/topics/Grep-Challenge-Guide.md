The next step is to open your file manager and unzip the file by double-clicking on the zip

Then, open the command line and navigate to the folder where you unzipped the file, this will most likely be the downloads folder. You can do this using the cd command E.G "cd downloads"

Then, you have to search the file using the "Grep" command. Grep locates the text which you search for through the command and the shows it in the command line. The format for this command is: 

grep "CTF" FindMe.dat

This command works to find the flag because all flags have the "CTF" aspect so it will print any word which includes the letters "CTF".
