# Guess The Pass Key Guide

## Overview

Backup Diesel Generators is a channel where you make use of binary manipulation* to alter the delivery address of a shipment
of diesel. 

The Biolab has had its electricity cut off and is relying on its backup diesel generators in order to sustain the condition
of the volatile virus prototype. However, they are running out of diesel and make an order for some more. By changing the
delivery address, the fuel would never arrive, starving the Biolab of power.

'*' Although initially intended to be a binary manipulation challenge, most tools represent binary in human readable hex,
which simplifies the challenge significantly.
