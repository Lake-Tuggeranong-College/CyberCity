By the time the sun forgot how to rise on Sodor, the Comedic Caboose Killer had already perfected the routine. First the tail cars, then the coaches, then the guards, porters, drivers—each disappearance delivered with immaculate timing and no encore. Knapford’s clocks still ticked, but only to themselves. Thomas steamed past empty platforms and silent sheds, counting ghosts where friends used to be: Percy’s shy lamp, Gordon’s proud huff, Henry’s careful listening, Annie and Clarabel’s chatter folded into the fog. The island had the quiet of a joke told once too often, then never again.

It was just Thomas and Sir Topham Hatt now—two stubborn survivors on a timetable written in pencil. They spoke softly, as if the air might notice and take offense. The Sir wore his best hat every day because there was no one left to tell him not to bother, and Thomas pulled the mail because sorrow still expects deliveries. When the rails sang that thin, lonely note, he didn’t check the couplings anymore; there was nothing left to lose but each other. Somewhere in the cuttings, the wind rehearsed a laugh that ended on a bow, and the fog applauded once. CTF{ah_choochoo}

One night, they paused on the viaduct where the last caboose had winked out like a tail lamp deciding not to shine. “We’ll carry on,” Sir Topham Hatt said, and it wasn’t brave—just accurate. Thomas nodded, staring into a horizon that refused to answer back. If the Killer was still out there, he had run out of cabooses, out of crowds, out of an audience. The punchline had killed the room. So the two of them went on: a gentleman with a timetable and an engine with a heartbeat, crossing the island that remained like a stage after the curtain falls—swept, silent, and somehow still needing the lights.
